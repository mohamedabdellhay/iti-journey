[00:00:21.031] Browser ERROR   Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.%s%s See https://react.dev/link/warning-keys for more information. 

Check the render method of `div`.  It was passed a child from ChatMessages.
[00:04:20.717] Browser ERROR   A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.
